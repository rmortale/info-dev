# ECS Cluster Deployer

Make sure you have Docker installed, and AWS Credentials set.

After you know that you have that, run `make put-pipeline` to deploy your cluster.

## Updating

To update your cluster, edit the infra.yml file with your new values and deploy. The cluster will automatically roll for you.
